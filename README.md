Exploring the Webpage Reader: Accessing, Controlling, and Recording Web Content

 

Accessing the Web page

When you access the webpage, you will notice a top navigation bar. Within this navigation bar, there will be an input box specifically designed for pasting the URL of the webpage you want to read. Once you have copied the URL of your desired webpage, simply paste it into the input box.

Next, you will find a play button adjacent to the input box. Clicking this play button will initiate the automatic reading of the webpage's content. You don't have to manually scroll or navigate through the text; the system will take care of that for you.

At the bottom of the webpage, you'll find a control button. This control button allows you to personalize the reading experience. You can adjust the voice of the reader, selecting different accents or languages if available. Additionally, you can modify the pitch of the voice to suit your preference, making the reading experience more comfortable and enjoyable.

Recording the Content:

The navigation bar features a record button. This functionality allows you to create an audio recording of the content being read aloud. By clicking the record button, you can generate an audio file or recording that you can save, refer to later, or share with others.
